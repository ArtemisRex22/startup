## Elevator Pitch
"The Pitch" <br>
Have you ever looked enviously at the Instagram book artists on your feed and wished that you had the resources to do something like that? I know I certainly have, and that's why I have created "Cover art". Cover art is a simple website that allows you to design the beautiful book covers that you have always dreamed of doing in real life. You'll have many different design options to choose from, customizing to make something that is undeniably yours. And, when you're done, you will shelf your book, and add it to a growing bookshelf compiled by those around the world. <br>
Key Features 
    - Login, for authorization and also to provide a name for the book author.
    - Various customization combinations.
    - A real-time worldwide bookshelf showcasing everyone's books.
    - A simple but pleasant background in which to create your book.
    - A simple GUI that will make for easy customization.
