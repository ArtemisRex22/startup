"Elevator Pitch" <br>
Have you ever looked enviously at the Instagram book artists on your feed and wished that you had the resources to do something like that? I know I certainly have, and that's why I have created "Cover art". Cover art is a simple website that allows you to design the beautiful book covers that you have always dreamed of doing in real life. You'll have many different design options to choose from, customizing to make something that is undeniably yours. And, when you're done, you will shelf your book, and add it to a growing bookshelf compiled by those around the world. <br>
Key Features: <br>
* Login, for authorization and also to provide a name for the book author. <br>
* Various customization combinations. <br>
* A real-time worldwide bookshelf showcasing everyone's books. <br>
* A simple but pleasant background in which to create your book. <br>
* A simple GUI that will make for easy customization. <br>
Technologies:<br>
- HTML - This uses correc HTML structure. One for login, one for customization, and one for online bookshelf.<br>
- CSS - Customization is the heart of this project so CSS will make not only the books pretty to look at but the environment of the website itself.<br>
- JavaScript - Provides login, customization display, and bookshelf display.<br>
- Service - Backend service with endpoints for login, retrieving customized books, and submitting finished books.<br>
- DB/Login - Store users and customized books in database. Will be used for registration, password, and usernames.<br>
- WebSocket - Wen a user submits a book, that book is uploaded to the database and displayed on the bookshelf.<br>
- React - Application ported to use the React web framework.<br>
